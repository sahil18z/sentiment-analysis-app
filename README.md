# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

## Overview
This is a simple Sentiment Analysis Web Application that allows users to input any text (such as tweets, reviews, or messages) and analyze its sentiment as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**. The sentiment result is displayed with clear color coding:
- **Green** for Positive
- **Red** for Negative
- **Grey** for Neutral

## Features
- User-friendly interface with a text input box and an "Analyze" button.
- Displays sentiment result with color coding.
- Uses a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face.
- Model runs either fully in-browser with TensorFlow.js or via a lightweight backend API.
- Responsive and publicly accessible on the internet.
  
### Bonus Features (If Implemented)
- Confidence percentages for each sentiment category.
- CSV upload for batch sentiment analysis.
- Saves and displays history of analyzed texts.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React/Vue/Angular if used)
- **Backend:** FastAPI / Flask (optional, if API used)
- **Machine Learning Model:** Pre-trained sentiment model from Hugging Face Transformers or TensorFlow.js
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify / Vercel / Hugging Face Spaces / Render / Railway (choose what you used)
  
## How It Works
1. User enters text in the input box and clicks "Analyze".
2. The frontend sends the text either directly to the Hugging Face API, runs the TensorFlow.js model locally, or sends it to the backend API.
3. The sentiment model predicts the sentiment label.
4. The result is returned and displayed with the appropriate color.

## Setup and Run Locally
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

### Frontend Only (TensorFlow.js / Hugging Face API approach)
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/sahil18z/sentiment-analysis-app
2. Open `index.html` (or run your frontend dev server):
npm install
npm start
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Backend API (FastAPI )
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
cd backend
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the API server:
4. The frontend will communicate with this API for sentiment predictions.

## Deployment
The app is deployed and publicly accessible at:  
[https://your-app-link.netlify.app](https://your-app-link.netlify.app)  

(If you have a backend API, include its deployed URL here as well.)
